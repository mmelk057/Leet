### 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower (Solved)
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.

You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):

```
-1 : My number is lower
 1 : My number is higher
 0 : Congrats! You got it!
```

Example :

```
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
```


### 383. Ransom Note (Solved)
Given an arbitrary ransom note string and another string containing letters from all the magazines, write a function that will return true if the ransom note can be constructed from the magazines ; otherwise, it will return false.

Each letter in the magazine string can only be used once in your ransom note.

Note:
You may assume that both strings contain only lowercase letters.

```
canConstruct("a", "b") -> false
canConstruct("aa", "ab") -> false
canConstruct("aa", "aab") -> true
```

### 389. Find the Difference (Solved)

Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in t.

Example:

```
Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.
```
