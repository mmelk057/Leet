### 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower (Solved)
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.

You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):

```
-1 : My number is lower
 1 : My number is higher
 0 : Congrats! You got it!
```

Example :

```
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
```


### 383. Ransom Note (Solved)
Given an arbitrary ransom note string and another string containing letters from all the magazines, write a function that will return true if the ransom note can be constructed from the magazines ; otherwise, it will return false.

Each letter in the magazine string can only be used once in your ransom note.

Note:
You may assume that both strings contain only lowercase letters.

```
canConstruct("a", "b") -> false
canConstruct("aa", "ab") -> false
canConstruct("aa", "aab") -> true
```

### 389. Find the Difference (Solved)

Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in t.

Example:

```
Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.
```

### 400. Nth Digit (Solved)

Find the nth digit of the infinite integer sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ...

Note:
n is positive and will fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer (n < 231).

Example 1:
```
Input:
3

Output:
3
```
Example 2:
```
Input:
11

Output:
0

Explanation:
The 11th digit of the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ... is a 0, which is part of the number 10.

### 434. Number of Segments in a String (Solved)

Count the number of segments in a string, where a segment is defined to be a contiguous sequence of non-space characters.

Please note that the string does not contain any non-printable characters.

Example:
```
Input: "Hello, my name is John"
Output: 5
```

### 438. Find All Anagrams in a String (Solved)

Given a string s and a non-empty string p, find all the start indices of p's anagrams in s.

Strings consists of lowercase English letters only and the length of both strings s and p will not be larger than 20,100.

The order of output does not matter.

Example 1:
```
Input:
s: "cbaebabacd" p: "abc"

Output:
[0, 6]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
```

### 404. Sum of Left Leaves (Solved) 

Find the sum of all left leaves in a given binary tree.

Example:
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7

There are two left leaves in the binary tree, with values 9 and 15 respectively. Return 24.
```

### 414. Third Maximum Number (Solved)

Given a non-empty array of integers, return the third maximum number in this array. If it does not exist, return the maximum number. The time complexity must be in O(n).

Example 1:
```
Input: [3, 2, 1]

Output: 1

Explanation: The third maximum is 1.
Example 2:
Input: [1, 2]

Output: 2

Explanation: The third maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.
```

Example 3:
```
Input: [2, 2, 3, 1]

Output: 1

Explanation: Note that the third maximum here means the third maximum distinct number.
Both numbers with value 2 are both considered as second maximum.
```

>>Memory Usage: 37.6 MB, less than 98.72% of Java online submissions for Third Maximum Number.

### 415. Add Strings (Solved)

Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as string, return the sum of num1 and num2.

Note:

- The length of both num1 and num2 is < 5100.
- Both num1 and num2 contains only digits 0-9.
- Both num1 and num2 does not contain any leading zero.
- You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.

### 448. Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array (Solved)

Given an array of integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.

Find all the elements of [1, n] inclusive that do not appear in this array.

Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.

Example:
```
Input:
[4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

Output:
[5,6]
```

### 453. Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements (Solved)

Given a non-empty integer array of size n, find the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal, where a move is incrementing n - 1 elements by 1.

Example:
```
Input:
[1,2,3]

Output:
3

Explanation:
Only three moves are needed (remember each move increments two elements):

[1,2,3]  =>  [2,3,3]  =>  [3,4,3]  =>  [4,4,4]
```
